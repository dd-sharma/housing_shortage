# Metro Areas

As of 2023, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has defined 393 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) across the country. These MSAs are regions with a high population density at their core and close economic ties throughout the area. Due to the extensive number of MSAs, utilizing the complete list for this project is not practical.

Focusing on the largest ten MSAs is more manageable given data limitations. Here are the top ten MSAs and their counties as of 2023:
